    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Very beautiful <emp>white bread</emp> made by your moma ahaha</p>

    </p>

    <p>_________________________________________</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>500g strong white flour, plus extra for dusting</li>
        <li>2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>7g sachet fast-action yeast</li>
        <li>3 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>300ml water</li>
    </ul>

    <p>_________________________________________</p>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <p>STEP 1</p>
        <li>Mix 500g strong white flour, 2 tsp salt and a 7g sachet of fast-action yeast in a large bowl.</li>
        <p>STEP 2</p>
        <li>Make a well in the centre, then add 3 tbsp olive oil and 300ml water, and mix well. If the dough seems a
            little stiff, add another 1-2 tbsp water and mix well.</li>
        <p>STEP 3</p>
        <li>Tip onto a lightly floured work surface and knead for around 10 mins.</li>
        <p>STEP 4</p>
        <li>Once the dough is satin-smooth, place it in a lightly oiled bowl and cover with cling film. Leave to rise
            for 1 hour until doubled in size or place in the fridge overnight.</li>
        <p>STEP 5</p>
        <li>Line a baking tray with baking parchment. Knock back the dough (punch the air out and pull the dough in on
            itself) then gently mould the dough into a ball.</li>
        <p>STEP 6</p>
        <li>Place it on the baking parchment to prove for a further hour until doubled in size.</li>
        <p>STEP 7</p>
        <li>Heat oven to 220C/fan 200C/gas 7.</li>
        <p>STEP 8</p>
        <li>Dust the loaf with some extra flour and cut a cross about 6cm long into the top of the loaf with a sharp
            knife.</li>
        <p>STEP 9</p>
        <li>Bake for 25-30 mins until golden brown and the loaf sounds hollow when tapped underneath. Cool on a wire
            rack.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3><strong>RECIPE TIPS</strong></h3>
    
    <p>_________________________________________</p>

    <h3>Saving time</h3>

    <p>
        A dough's first rising can be done in the fridge overnight. This slows down
        the time it takes to rise to double its size, giving it a deeper flavour. It's
        also a great timesaver, as you can start it the night before, then finish it
        off the next day.
    </p>



    <h3>Breadmaker</h3>

    <p>
        To make this in a breadmaker, add all the ingredients to your breadmaker and
        follow the manufacturers instructions.
