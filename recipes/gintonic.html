    <h2>Fun-fact</h2>
    <p>----------------------------------------</p>
    <p>
      London dry gins are very juniper-forward, and they vary significantly from
      modern-style gins, especially those featuring more citrusy and floral
      flavor profiles. When choosing your garnish, you can elect to highlight
      the flavors already in the gin, or add flavors that are absent from the
      gin. The same rule applies to the tonic water. Not every tonic is the
      same, as the quinine-and-botanical-laced beverage varies in sweetness,
      bitterness and herbal notes. So, your garnish should also work in concert
      with your tonic.
